		Welcome to my virtual tip jar project. This is a project to provide a virtual way for musicians to make some supplimental income.
		The site will offer a user to go to a band's profile and be able to tip virtually to the band with whatever method they want. they can use paypal, venmo, or they can even watch a commercial and the band would get the advertizing money from that commercial.
		the first page is your profile. it has your name, music genres you listen to and it has a list of bands in your band list with their hometown that the band is from and their playing style. There's only one band in there right now, Buddha Gift. 
		There's also a news feed that will display news about the bands on your list like tour dates, any new albums, and other things like that.
		There is also a box that searches through the database of bands, checks to see if their playing style matches your interests, and offers to add them to your list.
		Clicking on the list will bring you to the band's profile. You will find the band's hometown and their playing style. you will find an audio player that will play any music that the band has shared, an about section for the band, and the tip jar for that band.
		The paypal buttons are real, but the other button is a mock buttons. it just adds the number to the total for now. The total would only be displayed if it was the band viewing their own profile.
		The watch video button is going to be the advertizement for the band. a window will pop open and play the video. Right now its just one of my guitar videos. I have future plans for expanding on this idea, but right now I think this is a good base to work off of.
